	<p><h4>Verse 1</h4>Doctor, my eyes have seen the years<br>
And the slow parade of fears without crying<br>
Now I want to understand</p>
<p>I have done all that I could<br>
To see the evil and the good without hiding<br>
You must help me if you can
</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>Doctor, my eyes<br>
Tell me what is wrong<br>
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?</p>
<h4>Verse 2</h4>
<p>Cause I have wandered through this world<br>
And as each moment has unfurled<br>
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams<br>
People go just where they will<br>
I never noticed them until I got this feeling<br>
That it's later than it seems</p>
<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>Doctor, my eyes<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
I hear their cries<br>
Just say if it's too late for me</p>
<p>Doctor, my eyes<br>
Cannot see the sky<br>
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry?</p>
